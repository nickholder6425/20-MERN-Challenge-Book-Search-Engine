# 21-MERN-Challenge-Book-Search-Engine

## Description
This week's challenge involves updating a Google Books API search engine from using RESTful API to GraphQL with Apollo Server. The application, built on the MERN stack, allows users to save searches. Tasks include setting up Apollo Server, modifying authentication middleware for GraphQL, creating an Apollo Provider, and deploying the application on Render. This transformation reflects the demand for personalized data delivery and improved performance in modern web development.
